# HR Analytics: Unveiling Employee Insights for Workplace Excellence

This project delves into the intricacies of employee psychology through a comprehensive survey conducted on SurveyMonkey. With over 2000 employees from diverse roles, including Business Analysts, Platform Engineers, Data Engineers, and Software Developers, the survey encompassed a broad spectrum of perspectives. Its 80 carefully crafted questions, categorized into 15 distinct themes, captured a wealth of insights into employee perceptions of their team, manager, senior management, and the organization as a whole.

To ensure a thorough understanding of employee sentiment, the analysis meticulously examined data from various angles, including Operational Units (OUs), individual questions, roles, seniority levels, experience, and managerial relationships. This granular approach allowed for the identification of nuanced patterns and trends that would otherwise remain hidden.

Armed with these valuable insights, the project culminated in a self-explanatory dashboard that presents a concise and compelling narrative of the survey findings. This interactive visualization empowers decision-makers to readily grasp the key drivers of employee satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.

The project's overarching goal is to enable the organization to foster a workplace that consistently ranks among the Great Places to Work (GPTW) while minimizing attrition rates. By understanding the root causes of employee discontent, the organization can proactively address issues and cultivate a more engaged and productive workforce.

This project leverages a powerful combination of tools: SurveyMonkey for survey administration, Google Sheets for data storage and preliminary analysis, and Microsoft Power BI for in-depth data visualization and dashboard creation. This synergistic approach ensures that data is effectively collected, analyzed, and presented, maximizing the value of employee feedback.

**In conclusion, this HR Analytics project stands as a testament to the power of data-driven insights in shaping a thriving workplace. By transforming employee feedback into actionable intelligence, organizations can cultivate a culture of excellence that attracts, retains, and inspires top talent.**
